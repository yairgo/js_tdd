initially disable all inputs
when first frame is complete disable first frame and enable 2nd, and on through the rest
when clear input is clicked reset the page

when a frame is added to the game, if it knows it's score display it under the frame
 - see Game.isFrameComplete(index);
 - see Game.getScoreUpToFrame(index);
display the current total score
 - see Game.getTotalScore()
 
Make the input parser know what frame it is parsing and add the frame with the number to the game.
